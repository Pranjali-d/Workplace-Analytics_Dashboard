# Workspace-Analytics_case-study



This Workplace Analytics dashboard provides a quick and easy way to conduct a broad diagnostic on 2 themes: 
- company's "Collaboration culture" 
- "Employee experience"

The pages related to “Collaboration culture” will shed light on the collaboration behavior for different organizations and organizational levels and will introduce opportunities to act on to decrease collaboration overload.
The “Employee experience” related pages show emerging insights on employee well-being, as well as effective manager practices that may contribute to employee engagement.

**1. How is collaboration load impacting after-hours?**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49934575/202188437-9e2cd722-0a2f-4c51-83d2-03defd930292.png)  

Why it matters?
<br> High levels of collaboration during working hours can force spillover collaboration into after-hours time, eroding employee morale and contributing to burnout over time.

Insights:<br>- Operations engineering   organizations have the highest after-hours collaboration.<br> - correlations appear to exist between percentage of workweek in collaboration and after-hours collaboration hours.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2. How do employees spend their weekly collaboration time?**

Why it matters?
<br>Identifying and understanding differences in how organizations spend their collaboration time can shed light on broader differences between how teams get work done, and can in turn uncover both replicable best practices and areas of opportunity. At the same time, spotting patterns between certain types of collaboration and higher or lower after-hours collaboration time can reveal opportunities to improve work-life balance through small changes in the types of collaboration teams utilize.

Insights:
<br>- Do any organizations' predominant collaboration modes deviate notably from the other organizations? If so, are those differences easily explained by business context, or potentially worth deeper inquiry?
<br>- Do any correlations appear to exist between the collaboration types that organizations utilize and the prevalence of after-hours communication within those organizations?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3. How does the organization spend its meeting time?**

Why it matters?
<br>While some collaboration is best conducted through large or long meetings (e.g. all-hands, bloated, lengthy or workshop meetings), routinely using high consumption meeting practices can stall or hinder productivity and chip away at employee engagement over time.The proportion of meetings that are large, long, or both provides a glimpse into overall meeting effectiveness. Large or long meetings that are recurring tend to offer a high-value starting point for identifying opportunities to streamline.

Insights:
<br>- What percentage of meeting time gets consumed by Lengthy, Bloated, Workshop and All hands meetings?
<br>- What is the cost of those long or large meetings, in terms of FTE productivity equivalency?
<br>- What proportions of long or large meetings are recurring?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**4. How much time is going towards long or large meetings?**

Why it matters?
<br>-Analyzing meeting practices at the organization level can help pinpoint the root sources of meeting efficiency opportunities and inform early intervention points. It can also uncover organizational bright spots, where strong results suggest certain leaders are using best practices that could be replicated across the company. 

Insights:
<br>- Which organizations spend the highest percentage of their meeting time in long or large meetings? What might explain the prevalence of each meeting type within each organization?
<br>- Might any organizations with particularly streamlined meeting practices have replicable best practices for the rest of the company?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**5. Who in the org is generating the most workload**?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49934575/202199322-a722370d-dd42-48d4-ad34-bbbe68984ab6.png)

Why it matters?
<br>In order to streamline meeting practices, a company needs to understand which organizations and/or levels within the company “generate” the most meeting time. Often, this analysis shows meeting time generated by some organizations and/or levels is not commensurate with their population size. Having this delta is expected; the question is whether the delta makes sense, based on the nature of the organizations or levels that generate outsized impact.

Insights:
<br>- (Using the drop down) Is a relatively small proportion of the employee population generating an outsized percentage of meeting workload?
<br>- (Left side visual) How many meeting hours do most employees generate?
<br>- (Right side visual) Within the subset of employees generating the most workload, which organizations and levels are most strongly represented?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**6. Can employees reclaim time through scheduling practices?**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49934575/202200358-9beaef75-3f25-488d-b816-d06ea2d7095d.png)

Why it matters ?
<br>Not all unscheduled time during the workday has the same productivity potential. Concentrated work blocks of 2+ hours enable employees to drive projects to completion more quickly than fragmented pockets of time. Consider: if fragmented hours enable half the productivity of focused work time, then 8 hours of fragmented time each week represents half a workday squandered – multiplied across every employee, every week. Small changes to calendaring practices can reduce fragmentation and unlock more productivity from the same number of available weekly hours.

Insights:
<br>- How strongly do average meetings per week appear to correlate with average fragmented hours? Are there outlier organizations that buck the trend – meeting often without experiencing fragmentation?
<br>- Are there comparably sized organizations with similar meeting hours but different fragmentation levels? How about with similar fragmentation levels but different meeting hours? If so, might certain organizations have a best practices around calendar management or meeting discipline that others can learn from?

**7. Is multitasking driven by habit or necessity?**

Why it matters ?
<br>While multitasking rates will vary naturally based on meeting types and company dynamics, consistently high rates of multitasking suggest meetings are routinely not as effective as they could be, given that attendees are focused on other things. This analysis helps determine whether multitasking rates are more a function of employees’ habits or the consequence of high collaboration levels, driven by a necessity to catch up on emails during  meetings because there isn’t enough other free time during the workday. If driven by habit, there may be opportunity to target interventions toward chronic multitaskers.

Insights:
- (Left side visual) How strong (or weak) does the correlation appear to be between total avg. collaboration hours and avg. multitasking rates?
- (Right side visual) What differences stand out when comparing multitasking rates and multitasking dynamics across the organizations? 
- (Using slicer) What differences emerge between multitasking behaviors by level, with particular attention to Manager and Manager+, given their importance as decision-makers in meetings?
