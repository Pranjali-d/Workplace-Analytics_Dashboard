# Workspace-Analytics_case-study



This Workplace Analytics dashboard provides a quick and easy way to conduct a broad diagnostic on 2 themes: 
- company's "Collaboration culture" 
- "Employee experience"

The pages related to “Collaboration culture” will shed light on the collaboration behavior for different organizations and organizational levels and will introduce opportunities to act on to decrease collaboration overload.
The “Employee experience” related pages show emerging insights on employee well-being, as well as effective manager practices that may contribute to employee engagement.

**1. How is collaboration load impacting after-hours?**

Why it matters?
<br> High levels of collaboration during working hours can force spillover collaboration into after-hours time, eroding employee morale and contributing to burnout over time.

Insights:<br>- Operations engineering   organizations have the highest after-hours collaboration.<br> - correlations appear to exist between percentage of workweek in collaboration and after-hours collaboration hours.

**2. How do employees spend their weekly collaboration time?**

Why it matters?
<br>Identifying and understanding differences in how organizations spend their collaboration time can shed light on broader differences between how teams get work done, and can in turn uncover both replicable best practices and areas of opportunity. At the same time, spotting patterns between certain types of collaboration and higher or lower after-hours collaboration time can reveal opportunities to improve work-life balance through small changes in the types of collaboration teams utilize.

Insights:
<br>- Do any organizations' predominant collaboration modes deviate notably from the other organizations? If so, are those differences easily explained by business context, or potentially worth deeper inquiry?
<br>- Do any correlations appear to exist between the collaboration types that organizations utilize and the prevalence of after-hours communication within those organizations?

**3. How does the organization spend its meeting time?**

Why it matters?
<br>While some collaboration is best conducted through large or long meetings (e.g. all-hands, bloated, lengthy or workshop meetings), routinely using high consumption meeting practices can stall or hinder productivity and chip away at employee engagement over time.The proportion of meetings that are large, long, or both provides a glimpse into overall meeting effectiveness. Large or long meetings that are recurring tend to offer a high-value starting point for identifying opportunities to streamline.

Insights:
<br>- What percentage of meeting time gets consumed by Lengthy, Bloated, Workshop and All hands meetings?
<br>- What is the cost of those long or large meetings, in terms of FTE productivity equivalency?
<br>- What proportions of long or large meetings are recurring?

**4. How much time is going towards long or large meetings?**

Why it matters?
Analyzing meeting practices at the organization level can help pinpoint the root sources of meeting efficiency opportunities and inform early intervention points. It can also uncover organizational bright spots, where strong results suggest certain leaders are using best practices that could be replicated across the company.
